# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This is a small machine learning project where I built a web app to predict the chances of heart disease using patient health data.  
The goal of this project was to understand how ML models work in real applications and how to connect a trained model with a simple web interface.

## 💡 About the Project
I used a KNN model to make predictions based on input features like age, blood pressure, and other medical values.  
Users can enter their details through a form, and the app returns a prediction instantly.

This project helped me understand:
- how to train a basic ML model
- how Flask connects backend logic to a webpage
- how to structure a simple ML web application
